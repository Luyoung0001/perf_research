=== Combined Hyper-Threading + Prefetch Test ===
Array size per thread: 32 MB
Prefetch distance: 16 elements

Configuration                               Time(s)    Speedup
------------------------------------------------------------
Single thread, no prefetch                   0.0020      1.00x
Single thread, with prefetch                 0.0014       1.44x
Same core HT (0,8), no prefetch              0.0023       0.85x
Same core HT (0,8), with prefetch            0.0034       0.58x
Different cores (0,1), no prefetch           0.0023       0.88x
Different cores (0,1), with prefetch         0.0027       0.74x

=== Analysis ===
Prefetch improvement (single):     43.5%
HT same core improvement:          -14.6%
HT same core + prefetch:           -42.1%
Different cores improvement:       -11.6%
Different cores + prefetch:        -25.8%

Key findings:
1. Compare HT with/without prefetch to see if prefetch helps
2. Compare HT vs different cores for parallelism benefit
3. Best config is usually: different cores + prefetch
