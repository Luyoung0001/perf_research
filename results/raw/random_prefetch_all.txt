=== Random Access Prefetch Test ===
Array size: 64 MB
Access count: 10000000
Prefetch ahead: 8 steps

This is where software prefetch shines!
Hardware prefetcher cannot predict random access patterns.

=== No Prefetch (baseline) ===
Result: 41950766320752
Time: 0.0521 seconds
Throughput: 191.84 M accesses/sec
Avg latency: 5.2 ns/access

=== With Prefetch (single) ===
Result: 41950766320752
Time: 0.0516 seconds
Throughput: 193.68 M accesses/sec
Avg latency: 5.2 ns/access

=== Multi-level Prefetch (T0+T1) ===
Result: 41950766320752
Time: 0.0470 seconds
Throughput: 212.79 M accesses/sec
Avg latency: 4.7 ns/access

=== Analysis ===
For random access:
- Hardware prefetcher is ineffective
- Software prefetch can significantly reduce latency
- Key: prefetch far enough ahead to hide memory latency
- But not too far, or data may be evicted before use
